Task Management - Django REST Framework and React
Welcome to the Task Management project! This project combines a Django REST Framework backend for managing tasks with a React frontend for a modern user interface.

Project Structure

Django REST Framework Backend:

The backend is responsible for handling data storage, retrieval, and manipulation through RESTful APIs.
It provides endpoints for managing tasks, users, authentication, and authorization.
The backend is built using Django and Django REST Framework.
React Frontend:

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React.
It interacts with the backend APIs to provide a user-friendly interface for managing tasks.
The frontend is built using React, along with additional libraries such as React Router for navigation and Axios for making HTTP requests.
Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python and Node.js installed on your system.
Backend Setup
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the task_management directory:

sh
Copy code
cd task_management
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

sh
Copy code
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
.\env\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
Install Python dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Apply migrations to create the database schema:

sh
Copy code
python manage.py migrate
Run the development server:

sh
Copy code
python manage.py runserver
Your Django backend should now be running at http://localhost:8000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

sh
Copy code
cd frontend
Install Node.js dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm install
Start the development server:

sh
Copy code
npm start
Your React frontend should now be running at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Use the backend API endpoints to manage tasks, users, and authentication.
Interact with the React frontend to view and manipulate tasks through the user interface.
